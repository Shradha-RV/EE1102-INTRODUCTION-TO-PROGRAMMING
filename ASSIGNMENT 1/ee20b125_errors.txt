(Corrected by adding int main() under #include<math.h>)
It would be better to take p and t as float variables
(Corrected by adding float p,t;)

and replacing m in the formula to i = p*r/100*t/365)
Calculation of maturity amount is missing
(Corrected by adding m = i + p; and adding printf("Maturity amount is Rs %f\n",m);)
